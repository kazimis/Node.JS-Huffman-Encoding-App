## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to understand the importance of interaction of different programming language in developing large application. This application is a compresser app based on huffman encoding. The overall hope of this app is to be able to compress any file format. The memory effeciency of this encoding depends on the distribution of characters in file.

## Languages used

C++, Javascript and python is used for this application. C++ is used for Huffman encoding to acknowledge the fact that we need to use effecient programming language when huge CPU power is needed. Javascript is used to do the front end work and Nodejs is used to do the back-end work.

## Communication method

I use two communication methods function call and running language as executable file. In function call I used [N-API] to add [C++] addon in [Nodejs]. The second communication method that I used is calling other code from [Nodejs] using child process.

## How to run this App

To run this app it requires Node.js.

```python
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
